# Privacy & Data Handling

These workflows are designed for **personal and hobby use**. If you're processing sensitive data, read on.

## How Your Data Flows

```
Your data → n8n (local or cloud) → API providers (Groq, Gemini, etc.) → back to you
```

When a workflow runs, your data is sent to whichever AI provider the workflow uses. Each provider has their own privacy policies and data retention practices.

## Your Responsibility

Before processing anything sensitive, review each provider's privacy policy:

- **Groq** — [Privacy Policy](https://groq.com/privacy-policy/) · [Terms](https://groq.com/terms-of-use/)
- **Google Gemini** — [Privacy Notice](https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/13594961)
- **Google Workspace** — [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

Free tiers often have different (sometimes more lenient) data handling than paid plans. Some providers may use your data for model training unless you opt out.
